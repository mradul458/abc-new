Overview

I have completed this task in Laravel, implementing APIs for:

Creating classes

Booking a class

Additionally, I have documented the API using Swagger and implemented basic test cases using Laravel's built-in testing framework.

Features Implemented

API Endpoints for managing classes and bookings.

Database Storage: Data is stored in a database instead of memory or cache.

Validation: Input validation is implemented to ensure data integrity.

API Documentation using Swagger.

Test Cases using Laravel's built-in unit testing.

API Documentation

I have created API documentation using Swagger.

ðŸ“„ Swagger Documentation URL:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/documentation

You can visit this link to explore and test the available API endpoints.

Test Cases

I have written basic test cases using Laravel's built-in testing framework to ensure:

Class creation works as expected

Booking a class is successful

Validation errors are handled properly

Run the tests using:

php artisan test
